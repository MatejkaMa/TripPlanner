## Room to improvement

- Some sorting, filtering data operations are done on the main thread which could lead to some performance issues if there would be more data, but for this data samples it is not neededdue to time - Due to time constraints, I decided to skip the tests. I've honestly never really practiced the TDD method and it would slow me down a bit
